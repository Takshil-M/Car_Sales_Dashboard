This dashboard helps stakeholders analyze sales trends, growth metrics, budget allocations, and category-wise breakdowns for better decision-making.

Description
This dashboard visually presents car sales data using clean UI elements, focusing on:
Total Sales: 746K units sold.
Growth: 21.44% increase compared to the previous year.
Pre-Sales: 614K units booked before release.
Budget: $393.72K allocated.
Breakdown Categories:
Replacement: 5.3K
Servicing: 3.1K
Other: 1.8K


Additional features include:
A dynamic pie chart showing sales by category (Direct Sale, Pre Book, Third Party).
Monthly bar chart to track trends across the year.
Tabs for switching between different years (2019 to 2022).
Clean, minimal design for better user experience.

This dashboard was designed using modern design principles and can be implemented in web frameworks like React, HTML/CSS, or even Power BI for functionality.

Conclusion
This project is a modern, interactive car sales dashboard aimed at making complex data easy to understand for managers, analysts, and stakeholders. It provides deep insight into sales performance, trends, and budget usage. Future enhancements can include data integration and advanced analytics.
